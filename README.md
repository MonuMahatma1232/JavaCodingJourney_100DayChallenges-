# JavaCodingJourney_100DayChallenges-
Month 1: Core Java &amp; DSA. Solve 1-2 problems daily; upload to GitHub. Month 2: Small projects (to-do list, library); add features, test, document. Month 3: Advanced projects (Spring Boot/JavaFX); build full apps with CRUD, daily commits.

That sounds like a fantastic challenge! Hereâ€™s a plan to help you structure your daily coding tasks:

First Month - Core Java & DSA:

Focus on essential Java concepts (OOP, Collections, Streams, etc.) and DSA fundamentals.
Pick 1-2 coding problems daily from platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank.
Every day, upload the solutions to GitHub with comments on logic and approach.
Second Month - Java Projects:

Start small projects using Java, like a library management system or a to-do list app.
Each day, work on features, refactor code, and test.
Document your code and upload daily progress, aiming for code clarity and functionality.
Third Month - Advanced Topics & Full Projects:

Work on integrating Java with frameworks (Spring Boot or JavaFX).
For your final project, create a complete application (e.g., a personal finance tracker).
Update GitHub daily with code, test cases, and documentation.

Daily Coding Suggestions:
LeetCode or HackerRank: Try one question each day from these areas:
Arrays and Strings
Linked Lists
Stacks and Queues
Trees and Graphs
Dynamic Programming
Coding Patterns: Each week, focus on a specific pattern (like Sliding Window, Two Pointers, or Divide and Conquer).
Development Tasks by Month:
Month 1: Core Java and Algorithms
Day 1-7: Basic Java Programs (Loops, Conditions, Functions).
Day 8-15: Data structures basics (Array, List, Set).
Day 16-30: Solve DSA questions based on different patterns (e.g., sorting, searching, two-pointer).
Month 2: Small Java Projects
Day 1-7: To-Do List Application (Features: Add, edit, delete tasks).
Day 8-14: Library Management System (Features: Add books, manage inventory, issue books).
Day 15-21: Basic Calculator (GUI using JavaFX).
Day 22-30: Weather Application (Integrate a weather API and display data in a UI).
Month 3: Advanced Project with Spring Boot
Day 1-15: Personal Finance Tracker (Features: Track expenses, categorize spending, generate reports).
Day 16-30: Java Web Application with Spring Boot (Use a database and make it functional; CRUD operations, login system).
Tip: Add a README file in GitHub daily to document what you learned, your approach, and the logic.
